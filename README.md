# What is this?
Simple script to replace steam launch command with shell script to do more.


# Usage:
- Set steam launch option to this: "script/localtion/steam.sh %command%"
- Example "/home/mindi/.config/bspwm/scripts/steam.sh %command%"

That's it now just lookup games foldername and add commands that you like for it, you can even fix problems that you would need to fix manually on every launch (for example lookup mafia III entry line 72).
